> **CircuitSight AI** turns a circuit photograph, schematic, or electronics question into a grounded diagnostic conversation. Its assistant identity, **IDK — Intelligent Diagnostic Kernel**, is designed to explain what is visible, separate evidence from uncertainty, and guide the next useful check.

## What it does

CircuitSight is a visual electronics debugging and learning platform for breadboards, schematics, and circuit questions. Upload a clear image or ask a question in the workspace, then continue the conversation with context-aware answers, confidence language, current-path explanations, signal-path reasoning, and fault-tracing guidance.

The platform deliberately avoids presenting an uncertain visual inference as a measurement. When the evidence is incomplete, IDK says what is missing and asks for the next useful image, schematic, description, or measurement.

| Capability | Product behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Visual circuit analysis** | Interprets user-provided circuit images with multimodal AI assistance. |
| **Conversational diagnosis** | Maintains thread context so follow-up questions remain connected to the same analysis. |
| **Grounded reasoning** | Separates visible evidence, likely findings, uncertainty, and recommended checks. |
| **Complex-circuit guidance** | Supports current-path, signal-path, fault-trace, schematic, PCB, analog, digital, and mixed-signal explanations. |
| **Correction learning** | Stores user corrections and confirmations as reviewable evidence rather than silently retraining on unverified claims. |
| **Website help** | Provides a separate product-support chatbot for account, workflow, settings, and platform questions. |
| **Reporting** | Preserves structured findings, confidence information, original-image context, and PDF export when explicitly requested. |
| **Visual Signal** | Provides paired light/dark palettes, a side-by-side theme preview, high contrast, and route-scoped appearance controls. |

## Product flow

    A[Upload circuit image<br/>or ask a question] --> B[IDK multimodal analysis]
    B --> C[Evidence + confidence + uncertainty]
    C --> D[Current path / signal path / fault trace]

    C --> H[Optional report export]
```

### A workspace built around the signal

1. **Capture** — submit a circuit image or describe the problem.
2. **Inspect** — IDK identifies visible components, connections, likely fault points, and missing evidence.
3. **Understand** — receive a conversational explanation adapted to the diagnostic context.
4. **Verify** — follow recommended checks for power, polarity, continuity, and signal flow before energizing a circuit.
5. **Learn** — add a correction or confirmation that is stored for explicit review.

## Interface language

The UI follows a Kinetic Typography / brutalist visual direction: sharp geometry, high-contrast surfaces, technical labels, hard borders, acid signal accents, and responsive layouts. The current interface combines **Space Grotesk** for display and body text with **Monaspace Krypton** for diagnostic metadata.

The appearance system includes 16 paired visual signals. Each palette has a light reference and a dark reference, and the Visual Signal page can compare both variants without changing the active workspace mode.

> **Design principle:** make the signal visible, make uncertainty explicit, and keep the next action clear.

## Run locally

### Prerequisites

Use Node.js 22 or later and pnpm. The server-side environment also requires the project’s database, authentication, storage, and built-in AI integration variables.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server is started by the project’s Express/Vite entrypoint and binds to the environment-provided port.

### Quality checks

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Database migrations are generated through the project’s Drizzle workflow. Do not commit local environment secrets; configure the required variables through the deployment environment.

The most important product surfaces are:

- `client/src/pages/VisualSignal.tsx` — paired light/dark theme selection and preview.
- `client/src/components/AIChatBox.tsx` — reusable conversational interface.
- `server/routers.ts` — analysis, preferences, help chat, and feedback procedures.
- `drizzle/schema.ts` — persisted users, threads, messages, preferences, and reviewable feedback.

## Safety and evidence boundaries

CircuitSight is an analysis aid, not a replacement for electrical measurement or safe lab practice. A photograph cannot prove live voltage, current, continuity, component ratings, thermal conditions, or hidden connections. Verify power, polarity, continuity, and component behavior with appropriate instruments and safe procedures before energizing a circuit.

User corrections are captured as **pending review evidence**. They are not silently treated as verified truth, and the application does not fabricate reviews, ratings, testimonials, measurements, or external validation.
